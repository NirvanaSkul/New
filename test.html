<p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
<p class="copy">
At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing
there. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiferous bulb. Making many question whether there was vampire trauma inn his past.
